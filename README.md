Tools for geospatial analysis and remote sensing with Python

pygaarst is a library for Python to load and process remote sensing data
in commonly used formats. This includes combining data from different sources,
including GIS vector datasets; re-projecting with Proj4, mapping and plotting 
with Matplotlib. 

It was initiated on 2013-09-18, so it's still in an early stage of development.

There will be multiple dependencies, such as:

* GDAL for gdal, ogr and osr
* pyproj
* numpy, matplotlib and mpl_toolkits.basemap
* shapely, fiona, descartes
* netCDF4, h5py -- for netCDF, HDF5
* etc.
